# Audit severity classification

| Severity               | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical     | High           | Medium      |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High         | Medium         | Low         |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |

**Impact** - the technical, economic and reputation damage of a successful attack

**Likelihood** - the chance that a particular vulnerability gets discovered and exploited

**Severity** - the overall criticality of the risk

# Audit duration
Max 2 weeks (14 days)

# Disclaimer

A comprehensive security assessment of a smart contract can never ensure the total absence of vulnerabilities. This audit cannot guarantee absolute security, nor can it guarantee the detection of any issues in your smart contracts. To bolster security, it is highly advised to conduct subsequent security reviews, establish bug bounty programs, and implement on-chain monitoring.
